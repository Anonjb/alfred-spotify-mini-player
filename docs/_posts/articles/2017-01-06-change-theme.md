* You can switch to a different theme in settings menu:-

<figure>
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/change-theme1.jpg">
	<figcaption>Change theme in <b>Settings</b>.</figcaption>
</figure>

* After some time (icons are downloaded from the cloud), you should have the workflow in selected color:-

<figure>
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/change-theme2.jpg">
	<figcaption>Selected theme icons.</figcaption>
</figure>

Note: To get back to original version with green icons, simply re-install the workflow (settings and library will be preserved)
