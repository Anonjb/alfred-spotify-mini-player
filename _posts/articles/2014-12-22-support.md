If you experience an issue with the workflow, follow these steps:-

* Before opening an issue, you can also have a look at the list of [known issues]( {{ site.url }}/known-issues)

* Open an issue on the [Github page](https://github.com/vdesabou/alfred-spotify-mini-player/issues/new). You can also use command `spot_mini_issue` to open the issue:-

    <figcaption>Open an issue on Github page.</figcaption>
</figure>

* Describe in a few words what's the problem. [You can also say _hi_ and _thanks_, yes, I'm a human and I am absolutely not paid to do all of this!]

* Use the `spot_mini_debug` keyword input (note that if an exception occurs, it is automatically called). This will generate a `spot_mini_debug.tgz` file in your _Downloads_ directory.

* Send the `spot_mini_debug.tgz` to this [email](mailto:alfred.spotify.mini.player@gmail.com) (you can also use the _Send an email to the author_ option when using `spot_mini_debug`)

<a name="note_regenerate_client_secret"></a>

**Note:** With the `spot_mini_debug.tgz`, I'll have access to your Spotify library (but not your Spotify password, don't worry :smile:). This is only for the time of investigation. Once investigation is over, you can regenerate a _Client Secret_, as explained in the [Spotify Application page](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications):-
{: .notice-info}
