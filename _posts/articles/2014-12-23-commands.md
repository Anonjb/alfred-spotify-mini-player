Spotify Mini Player has a full list of commands that you can invoke. 
For each command, you can also define an [hotkey](http://support.alfredapp.com/workflows:config:triggers-hotkey).

## List of commands

This is the list of all possible commands (click to see in fullscreen):-

## Quick access in main menu

You can also invoke commands from the main menu. You can access the list of commands by starting your search by a `space`, see example:-
