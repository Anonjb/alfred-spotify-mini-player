## Refresh Library

* Every time you update Your Music or add a track/album/playlist to a playlist, the workflow automatically updates the library and you'll get notifications:-

* In case you have modified a playlist or added tracks to Your Music using the Spotify application directly, then you can force a Refresh Library:-

  * Use the `refresh_library` command:-

  * Use the `Refresh your library` in Settings menu:-

## Background download of artworks

Since version 6, the workflow downloads artworks in background, which means that the Create/Refresh Library is very fast.

You get a notification when background download of artworks starts:-

	<figcaption>Notification for the start of background download of artworks.</figcaption>
</figure>

* During that time, you can use the workflow and you'll see the progress at the top of main menu:-

	<figcaption>Progress bar for background download of artworks.</figcaption>
</figure>

* Until the download is complete, you can see some blank artworks, that's expected:-

## Re-Create Library from scratch

If for some reasons you want to delete and re-create your entire library, you can select ```Re-Create your library from scratch``` in Settings menu:-
