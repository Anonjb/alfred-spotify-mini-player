## Refresh Library

* Every time you update Your Music or add a track/album/playlist to a playlist, the workflow automatically updates the library and you'll get notifications:-

* In case you have modified a playlist or added tracks to Your Music using the Spotify application directly, then you can force a Refresh Library:-

  * Use the ```refresh_library``` command:-
