OSX and [growl](http://growl.info) notifications are supported.

* You can enable "Now Playing" notifications (enabled by default), to get a notification every time a song changes:-

<figure class="half">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/now-playing.jpg"></a>
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/now-playing3.jpg"></a>
	<figcaption>Examples of notifications.</figcaption>
</figure>

You get in the notification:- 

  * the name of the song
  * the artist and album name
  * track length
  * track popularity
  * a beautiful artwork. (only with osx notification)

* You can disable this option at any time in Settings menu:-
