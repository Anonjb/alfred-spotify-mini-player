Spotify is currently deploying a version 1.0.1.x (latest one is `1.0.1.1060.gc75ebdfd`) which breaks the [AppleScript](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Help-Desktop-Linux-Mac-and/Apple-scripting-broken-in-1-0-1-988-g8f17a348/td-p/1029434) support.

This version is a big downgrade, many users are complaining on their [forums](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Help-Desktop-Linux-Mac-and/The-latest-desktop-version-is-a-downgrade/td-p/1039724) because a lot of existing features have been removed or are no more working(AppleScript support is one of them).

Spotify is releasing a buggy version to people and this is unacceptable!! 

If you're one of the users who have been upgraded to 1.0.1.x version, the workflow will no more work. See this [issue](https://github.com/vdesabou/alfred-spotify-mini-player/issues/66) for more details. 

The only way is to revert back to previous Spotify version by following steps [here](http://supraliminal.net/blog/2013/4/21/how-to-revert-back-to-the-older-better-spotify-client), see section _MAC OS X_.
Note that you can download `0.9.15.27` and not `0.8.5.1356` as described in the article.
