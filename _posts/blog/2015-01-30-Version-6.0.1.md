First of all, version 6.0 is a huge success! 
Welcome to the new users and thanks to everybody!

Some of you have experienced problem when creating the library, most of the time the exceptions reported by the workflow looked like:-

* no such table: artists error

* Web API Exception: No ’error’ provided in response body

This is now fixed in [version 6.0.1](https://github.com/packal/repository/raw/master/com.vdesabou.spotify.mini.player/spotifyminiplayer.alfredworkflow)

Important: If you got issue with library creation with version 6.0, you need to follow steps [here](http://alfred-spotify-mini-player.com/articles/support/) and choose 'Browse to App Support Folder', then in Finder, delete `library.db` and `fetch_artworks.db` files before re-creating the library.
