If you experience an issue with the workflow, use the "spot_mini_debug" command, it will generate a spot_mini_debug.tgz file in your *Downloads* directory. Then send this file to me.

If the update library is stuck (be aware the first time, it can take some time as all artworks are downloaded, next times my entire library (1680 tracks) updates in only 40 seconds), you can kill it by invoking "spot_mini_kill" command:
