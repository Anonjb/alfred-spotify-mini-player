Spotify Mini Player has full support of [Alfred hotkeys](http://support.alfredapp.com/workflows:config:triggers-hotkey) to invoke the workflow and for every possible action !

## Invoke workflows with hotkeys

It is highly recommended to use hotkeys to invoke the workflow rather than the keyword _spot_mini_

To setup hotkeys, see example below:
