You can decide to search in your starred playlist only, or in all all your playlists. You can browse by Artist, Album or Playlist. You can also lookup for artists online. You can also control Spotify using keywords such as play/next/volmax/random/shuffle/star/etc...\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n* Search in all your playlists\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://d.pr/i/MeWd+.gif)\r\n\r\n* Browse and launch your playlists\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://d.pr/i/ECCf+.gif)\r\n\r\n* Update your playlist and see progress\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://d.pr/i/uSB4+.gif)\r\n\r\n* Browse by artist\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://d.pr/i/QJU1+.gif)\r\n\r\n* Lookup artist \"online\"\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://d.pr/i/y1Wb+.gif)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Hotkey to trigger the workflow\r\n* Update of playlists directly from the workflow!\r\n* Search for Albums, Artists or Tracks\r\n* Search for playlists (including your Top List), browse them and launch them\r\n* Browse by Artists, Albums or Playlists\r\n* **Lookup artist online** by using ctrl key on a track\r\n* **Alfred Playlist** manage a playlist from Alfred: add track (using fn), albums or playlist (using ⇧)\r\n* Select a track with ⌥ to play the album, or ⌘ to play the artist\r\n* Same control keywords as iTunes Mini Player: play, pause, mute, next, random, previous, volmax, volmid.
