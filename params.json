You can decide to search in your starred playlist only, or in all all your playlists. You can browse by Artist, Album or Playlist. You can also lookup for artists online, search for lyrics, get related artists, display biography, etc..\r\nYou can also control Spotify using keywords such as play/next/volmax/random/shuffle/star/unstar/etc...\r\n\r\n## Screencast\r\n\r\nSee it in action here [screencast](http://quick.as/nmwxcxx0)\r\n\r\n## Animated Gifs\r\n\r\n* Search in all your playlists\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://i.cloudup.com/pKTGG2faiC.gif)\r\n\r\n* Browse and launch your playlists\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://i.cloudup.com/A9tePlpX1S.gif)\r\n\r\n* Update your playlist and see progress\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://i.cloudup.com/tx8lqblTEu.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Lookup artist \"online\"\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://i.cloudup.com/zbv6NCInTi.gif)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Hotkey to trigger the workflow\r\n* Update of playlists directly from the workflow!\r\n* Search for Albums, Artists or Tracks\r\n* Search for playlists (including your Top List), browse them and launch them\r\n* Browse by Artists, Albums or Playlists\r\n* **Lookup artist online** by using ctrl key on a track\r\n* **Alfred Playlist** manage a playlist from Alfred: add track (using fn), albums or playlist (using ⇧)\r\n* Select a track with ⌥ to play the album, or ⌘ to play the artist\r\n* Same control keywords as iTunes Mini Player: play, pause, mute, next, random, previous, volmax, volmid.

Then send this file to me.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://i.cloudup.com/rkqaeTehJK.png)\r\n\r\nIf the update library is stuck (be aware the first time, it can take hours as all artworks are downloaded, next times it shall not exceed 10 minutes), you can kill it by invoking \"spot_mini_kill\" command:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://i.cloudup.com/rusuJc78Wg.png)\r\n\r\nIf you want to report an issue or propose an enhancement, use the \"spot_mini_issue\" command.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n* [Spotifious workflow](https://github.com/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred)\r\n* [Ratchet](http://socketo.me)\r\n* [SpotCommander](https://github.com/olejon/spotcommander)\r\n* [Terminal-Notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
