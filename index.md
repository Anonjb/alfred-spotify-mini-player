Alfred Spotify Mini player uses a local version of your entire Spotify library stored in a database, that's why it is so quick ! 
You can browse by Artist, Album or Playlist. You can also lookup for artists or album online, display lyrics, artist biographies, get related artists, get featured playlists, get charts, etc..
You can also control Spotify using keywords such as play/next/random/shuffle/etc...
